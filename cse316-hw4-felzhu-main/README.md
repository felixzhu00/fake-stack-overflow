<h1>Fake Stack Overflow - Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the "Fake Stack Overflow-Assignment1" repository! This repository is part of a series of repositories aimed at recreating an imitation of the existing forum website "Stack Overflow." The goal of these repositories is to develop a forum with similar features while learning the fundamentals of full-stack web development and exploring increasingly advanced concepts and frameworks during the development phase. As I progress with subsequent assignments, I will continue to build upon this solid foundation, introducing a diverse array of additional technologies and techniques that will significantly enhance and broaden my skill set.</p>

<h2>Repository Focus</h2>
<p>
In this repository, our focus is to develop a server using Node.js and utilize MySQL as the back-end database. With Node.js, we can host both static and dynamic resources, creating interactive web applications. MySQL provides a reliable and well-established solution for managing relational databases. By mastering these concepts, we gain the ability to build robust and efficient applications, seamlessly integrating front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>The objective of this assignment is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn server-side programming.</li>
    <li>Understand the principles of Relational Databases.</li>
    <li>Gain experience with full-stack development using Node and MySQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>MySQL Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Robust and proven:</strong> MySQL is a mature and widely adopted relational database management system (RDBMS) with a long-standing track record. It has been extensively used in various industries and applications, demonstrating its stability and reliability.</li>
  <li><strong>ACID compliance:</strong> MySQL ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, providing transactional integrity and reliability. It guarantees data consistency and reliability, making it suitable for critical applications that require strict data consistency.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL Standard:</strong> MySQL adheres to the SQL (Structured Query Language) standard, making it compatible with a wide range of SQL-based applications and tools. It provides a familiar and standardized language for querying and managing data.</li>
  <li><strong>Community support and ecosystem:</strong> MySQL benefits from a large and active community of users and developers. It has an extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, providing resources and support for efficient database management and application development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other tools involved:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Express.js:</strong> Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features and middleware that simplifies the process of building web applications. Express.js helps in handling routes, requests, and responses, making it easier to develop the server-side of your application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Nodemon:</strong> Nodemon is a utility tool that automatically restarts your server whenever changes are made to your code. It helps in the development process by saving you the effort of manually restarting the server after every code modification. Nodemon improves productivity and speeds up the development workflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Axios:</strong> Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the client-side of your application. It provides an easy-to-use API for sending asynchronous requests to the server and handling the responses. Axios simplifies the process of fetching data from external APIs or interacting with your own server-side endpoints.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CORS:</strong> CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows web browsers to securely make requests to a different domain than the one the website originated from. CORS is important when your client-side code needs to communicate with a server hosted on a different domain. It enables the server to control which origins are allowed to access its resources, ensuring secure and controlled data exchange between different domains.
