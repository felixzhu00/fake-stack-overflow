<h1>Fake Stack Overflow - Assignment 1</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the "Fake Stack Overflow-Assignment1" repository! This repository is part of a series of repositories aimed at recreating an imitation of the existing forum website "Stack Overflow." The goal of these repositories is to develop a forum with similar features while learning the fundamentals of full-stack web development and exploring increasingly advanced concepts and frameworks during the development phase. As I progress with subsequent assignments, I will continue to build upon this solid foundation, introducing a diverse array of additional technologies and techniques that will significantly enhance and broaden my skill set.</p>

<h2>Repository Focus</h2>
<p>In this particular repository, my primary focus is to master the fundamental aspects of front-end development, which involve the essential trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tools will be used to create and design the visual and interactive elements of a website that users directly see and interact with.</p>

<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>The objective of this assignment is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create static web pages using HTML/CSS.</li>
    <li>Add dynamic behavior to web pages using JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Implement a basic MVC architecture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Structure</h2>
<p>The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The components are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Model:</strong> JavaScript modules that define the data model.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>View:</strong> The HTML pages that users interact with.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Controller:</strong> JavaScript modules that handle user interactions and manipulate the data.</p></li>    
</ul>
