<h1>Fake Stack Overflow - Assignment 3</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the "Fake Stack Overflow-Assignment1" repository! This repository is part of a series of repositories aimed at recreating an imitation of the existing forum website "Stack Overflow." The goal of these repositories is to develop a forum with similar features while learning the fundamentals of full-stack web development and exploring increasingly advanced concepts and frameworks during the development phase. As I progress with subsequent assignments, I will continue to build upon this solid foundation, introducing a diverse array of additional technologies and techniques that will significantly enhance and broaden my skill set.</p>

<h2>Repository Focus</h2>
<p>
In this repository, our focus is to develop a server using Node.js and leverage MongoDB as the back-end database. With Node.js, we can host both static and dynamic resources, creating interactive web applications. MongoDB ensures efficient data management and persistence. By mastering these concepts, we gain the ability to build robust and scalable applications, seamlessly integrating front-end and back-end technologies.</p>


<h2>Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>The objective of this assignment is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn server-side programming.</li>
    <li>Understand the principles of NoSQL Databases.</li>
    <li>Gain experience with full-stack development using Node and MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<h2>MongoDB advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flexible data model:</strong> MongoDB's schema-less approach allows for easy adaptation and modification of data structures as application requirements evolve. It provides greater flexibility in handling diverse and evolving data formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Expressive querying:</strong> MongoDB's query language supports complex queries, filtering, sorting, and aggregation. It enables dynamic querying and schema-less data exploration, providing more flexibility in data retrieval and analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability and performance:</strong> MongoDB is designed for high-performance and horizontal scalability. It efficiently handles large volumes of data, thanks to efficient indexing, in-memory processing, and data locality optimizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Native JSON storage:</strong> MongoDB natively stores data in a JSON-like format, eliminating the need for complex ORM layers. This simplifies data handling and integration with modern web development and API frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other tools involved:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>MongoDB Compass:</strong> MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that provides a visual way to interact with MongoDB databases. It allows you to easily view and manage your MongoDB data, query documents, analyze schema, and perform administrative tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>express.js:</strong> Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features and middleware that simplifies the process of building web applications. Express.js helps in handling routes, requests, and responses, making it easier to develop the server-side of your application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>mongoose:</strong> Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to define schemas, perform validations, and interact with MongoDB. Mongoose simplifies the process of connecting to a MongoDB database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>nodemon:</strong> Nodemon is a utility tool that automatically restarts your server whenever changes are made to your code. It helps in the development process by saving you the effort of manually restarting the server after every code modification. Nodemon improves productivity and speeds up the development workflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>axios:</strong> Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the client-side of your application. It provides an easy-to-use API for sending asynchronous requests to the server and handling the responses. Axios simplifies the process of fetching data from external APIs or interacting with your own server-side endpoints.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CORS:</strong> CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows web browsers to securely make requests to a different domain than the one the website originated from. CORS is important when your client-side code needs to communicate with a server hosted on a different domain. It enables the server to control which origins are allowed to access its resources, ensuring secure and controlled data exchange between different domains.
